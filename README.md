# Rocket Engine Simulator

Rocket Engine Simulator is an educational, strategic simulation game where players design, build, and test liquid rocket engines using real-world physics. You run a scrappy startup rocket company, balancing cost, mass, complexity, and reliability across a campaign of increasingly challenging levels while learning authentic rocket engineering concepts through hands-on experimentation.

## Core Experience

- **Design–Build–Test loop**: select a level goal, assemble an engine from components, run a test fire, analyze performance, and iterate.
- **Meaningful trade-offs**: budget constraints (money, weight, complexity, propellant) force smart engineering decisions.
- **Progressive mastery**: unlock advanced components, materials, and propellants as you move from a garage workshop to a world-class test facility.
- **Accessible realism**: physics-driven thrust, Isp, chamber pressure, and thermal loads are simplified where needed while still teaching real principles.
- **Narrative flavor**: witty startup banter and real-world engineering challenges frame each milestone.

## Repository Purpose

This repository will ultimately be the home for the game’s source code, tools, and supporting assets as development progresses.
